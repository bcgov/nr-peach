## Installation Guide

This section outlines how to quickly set up and run the app locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your machine before you can proceed:

- Install [Node.js 22 LTS](https://nodejs.org) or higher
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Install VSCode [Recommended Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_workspace-recommended-extensions)
  - This can be done by searching `@recommended` in the Extensions tab, and then
    clicking the `Install Workspace Recommended Extensions` button.
- Install Postgres 16.x or higher

### Install

```sh
npm ci
```

This command installs the dependencies as defined by the lockfile.

#### Environment Variables

```sh
cp .env.default .env
```

If you do not have a `.env` file in the root directory, create a copy of the
`.env.default` and modify as necessary.

### Run Local Development

```sh
npm run migrate:latest
```

This command ensures that your database schema is up-to-date.

```sh
npm run seed:run
```

This command pre-populates your database with common data entries non-destructively.

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server watching the source code
directory. Most user changes will automatically reboot the server.

### Run Production

```sh
npm run start
```

This command starts the server in production mode.
